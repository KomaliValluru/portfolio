Welcome to my digital portfolio! I’m a **Data Engineer** with a passion for transforming complex data into impactful, business-ready solutions. From real-time data pipelines to AI-powered applications, I love creating systems that are as scalable as they are insightful.

With experience across **finance**, **marketing**, **customer care**, and **enterprise platforms**, I bring a cross-functional approach to every challenge. Whether it’s designing ETL pipelines, orchestrating cloud workflows, or fine-tuning machine learning models, I aim to deliver clarity through data.
